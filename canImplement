TO-DO:


1.Daemonise Supervisor and scheduling of it.
-Upstart test - done
-Daeminie process - not working

PSQL.CPP:
;Need to do error handling

Access.CPP
;Need to convert every char* to string and make it fully C++ style

myregex.CPP
;TODOs in processIdFinder

dispatcher.CPP
;make the Infinite while loop more efficient with somethng other measure
;for recvall() and sendall() - Need to do something if error occurs.
;make login a loop if incorrect login
;make wrong choice as repeaating loop
;make communication dynamic instead of sequential
;Connecting to database for every user make it one time (make a function which return the PGcon  object . 
	Call it every time not one time like if object was previously creted then return that else make a new 
	connection and return that -> this will sove the problem That if we connected to database one time and 
	the after sometime the connection broke , then our program will crash)

;Do same for the unixClientSocket - Now calling it every time
;Need to use send_err in send_fd and understand it and then do its error handling

Make:
;Need to amke .h of all the files 
;need to learn make thoroughly and then to build depedency perfectly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




strerror_r instead of strerror as first one is threadsafe
Need to change printf to cin and cout
dispatcher signal handler
change syntax to c++;
learn to use sql in c++
json







2.Supervise the supervisor via handling all the signals and think something of two exception signals. - Password , best handing procedures.
3.Search and Test for any case when SIGCHILD not generated.
4.Json - Basic Done
5.SQL - GOING ON
6.UNIX Domain Sockets
7.Error handling of Supervisor - Going On
8.Vidisha's segmentation fault error
9.No need of #include then error
10.No need of access.o in supervisor in makefile's supervisor target - DONE
11.Handel Bind Ports error - DONE
12.Handel Binary Files. - Done
